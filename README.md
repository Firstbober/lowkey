# Lowkey

**Lowkey** is a high-performance, end-to-end encrypted chat platform born from a high-intensity two-week hackathon. My mission is to bridge the gap between the seamless UX of Discord and the sovereign privacy of Matrix, all while architecting for a post-quantum future.

## Why?

The catalyst for Lowkey was Discord's move toward enforcing ID checks via third-party providers—entities with a [concerning history of data breaches](https://proton.me/blog/discord-age-verfication-breach). While I view Matrix as a significant step forward for digital sovereignty, it still struggles to match the high-polish "feel" that makes Discord so popular.

Faced with this trade-off, several friends and I agreed that we could do better. We set out on a challenge: **who can build a superior messaging platform in just two weeks?**

While the hackathon provided the spark for this repository, the architectural ideas behind Lowkey have been brewing in my mind for over half a year. This project represents the formalization and execution of those long-standing efforts into a singular, cohesive vision. (well, somewhat)

## My Vision

Encrypted messaging shouldn't feel like a compromise. Lowkey is built to prove that world-class features and "unbreakable" privacy can coexist.

* **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):** Future-proofing communications against the eventual reality of quantum computing.
* **Discord-Grade UX:** A polished, intuitive interface that rivals mainstream, non-encrypted alternatives.
* **Massive Scalability:** Engineered to handle hundreds of thousands of concurrent users without the latency typical of E2EE systems.
* **Uncompromised Features:** Supporting high-speed message search and media sharing without breaking the encryption boundary.
* **Mobile-First Architecture:** Designed from the ground up for mobile efficiency—minimizing battery drain while maximizing responsiveness.
